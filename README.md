# MongoDB_Specimen ðŸ§¬

Welcome to the **MongoDB_Specimen** repository! This is where I store and experiment with MongoDB CRUD operations, exploring how to structure, query, and manipulate data like biological specimens in a lab.

## What's Inside
- MongoDB CRUD operations examples with Nodejs
- Simple database interactions and queries
- Various experiments and learning notes

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo:  
   `git clone https://github.com/AntoJebi7/MongoDB_Specimen.git`

2. Install dependencies (if applicable):  
   `npm install`

3. Run the sample scripts or experiment with your own MongoDB database.
